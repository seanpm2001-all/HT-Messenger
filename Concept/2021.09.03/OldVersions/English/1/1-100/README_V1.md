## Features

Instant responses, attribute a common/known symptom/problem through a searchable query, and immediately label a patient with this problem

Text messaging support (Vern said that current hospitals still use pagers, although I like that that technology is still being used, it is pretty outdated. I will make sure that privacy on this program can get as close as possible to (or better) than a paging system

Full on privacy (mandatory)

E2EE (mandatory)

512 bit encryption (as 256 bit encryption can still be cracked and is still trying to be cracked)

Image support (JPG, JPEG, JFIF, JIF, GIF, HEIF, TIF, TIFF, BMP, DIP, WIM, SVG, ICO, PNS, etc.)

Interface support (being able to change between flat design and Skeuomorphism without any issue)

Instant access to patients between their caretakers, and the ability to cut the connection if needed (for maximum privacy)

Cross-platform support (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, BSD, Solaris)

Compatibility with other SMS messaging apps

Privacy focused voice search

HIPAA compliance (mandatory)
